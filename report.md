# Security Audit Report: Cloudflare R2D2 Dashboard

## Overview
This report summarizes findings from a security audit of the Cloudflare R2D2 Dashboard application, with a focus on API endpoint authentication and authorization mechanisms. The audit was conducted to identify potential security vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized access, data leakage, or other security incidents.

## Executive Summary
The application implements Next.js 15 with a JWT-based authentication system. While the frontend routes appear to be protected through middleware, the API routes lack consistent authentication and authorization checks, creating several security concerns that should be addressed.

## Critical Findings

### 1. Missing API Authentication Checks
**Severity: Critical**

Most API endpoints do not explicitly verify that requests are coming from authenticated users. While the frontend application has middleware to prevent unauthenticated users from accessing pages, the API endpoints themselves can be directly accessed without authentication checks.

**Affected Endpoints:**
- `/api/buckets`
- `/api/buckets/[name]/objects`
- `/api/buckets/[name]/objects/[...key]`

**Recommendation:**
Implement authentication middleware for all API routes that verifies that requests come from authenticated users by checking for valid JWT tokens.

### 2. Lack of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
**Severity: High**

The authentication system includes a 'role' field in the user model, but this role is not leveraged in API endpoints to enforce authorization policies. All authenticated users might have the same level of access to all resources.

**Recommendation:**
Implement proper RBAC checks for sensitive operations such as:
- Bucket creation/deletion
- Object deletion
- Setting bucket public access
- Admin configuration changes

### 3. Missing CSRF Protection
**Severity: High**

No explicit CSRF protection mechanisms were found for API endpoints that perform state-changing operations (POST, DELETE). This could allow attackers to perform actions on behalf of authenticated users through CSRF attacks.

**Recommendation:**
Implement CSRF tokens for all state-changing operations or ensure that Next.js's built-in CSRF protection is properly configured.

### 4. Credential Caching Risks
**Severity: Medium**

The application caches R2 credentials in memory with a 5-minute TTL. While this improves performance, it poses risks if the application is compromised:
- Cached credentials could be exposed through memory inspection
- Key rotation doesn't immediately invalidate cached credentials

**Recommendation:**
- Consider shorter TTL for cached credentials
- Implement mechanisms to immediately invalidate cached credentials when keys are rotated
- Encrypt cached credentials in memory if possible

### 5. Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
**Severity: High**

API endpoints like `/api/buckets/[name]/objects/[...key]` use user-controllable inputs directly in object retrieval without verification that the user has access to the specified bucket/object.

**Recommendation:**
Implement resource-based access control that verifies a user's permission to access specific buckets and objects before processing requests.

### 6. Error Handling Leaks Information
**Severity: Medium**

API error responses frequently include detailed error messages and even stack traces. This could leak sensitive information about the application structure and configuration.

**Affected Endpoints:**
- `/api/buckets/[name]/objects/[...key]` - Returns detailed error information including stack traces

**Recommendation:**
Implement standardized error handling that logs detailed errors server-side but returns generic error messages to clients.

### 7. Lack of Rate Limiting
**Severity: Medium**

No rate limiting mechanisms were identified for API endpoints, potentially allowing brute force attacks or denial of service.

**Recommendation:**
Implement rate limiting for all API endpoints, especially authentication-related ones.

### 8. Missing Input Validation
**Severity: Medium**

Some API endpoints perform minimal validation of user input, potentially allowing injection attacks or other security issues.

**Affected Endpoints:**
- `/api/buckets/[name]/objects` - Limited validation of file uploads
- Search parameters lack thorough validation

**Recommendation:**
Implement comprehensive input validation for all API endpoints using a validation library.

## Out-of-the-Box Issues

### 1. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Risk
**Severity: High**

The application makes HTTP requests to the Cloudflare API using user-supplied bucket names and other parameters. Without proper validation, this could potentially lead to SSRF attacks if input is not properly sanitized.

**Affected Code:**
- Bucket detail retrieval in `/api/buckets/route.ts`
- Public access configuration when creating buckets

**Recommendation:**
Implement strict validation of all user-supplied parameters used in API requests.

### 2. Potential Local File Inclusion via Object Paths
**Severity: Medium**

Object keys are directly used in path construction. In certain scenarios, specially crafted keys might potentially allow access to files outside intended directories if not properly validated.

**Recommendation:**
Implement path normalization and validation to prevent directory traversal attacks.

### 3. Missing Authentication for Public Bucket Access
**Severity: High**

The application allows setting buckets as publicly accessible, but there's no additional authentication step required for this sensitive operation.

**Recommendation:**
Require additional confirmation or elevated permissions for making buckets publicly accessible.

### 4. Hardcoded Credentials Risk
**Severity: Medium**

While not directly observed in the code, there's a risk of developers hardcoding R2 credentials during development. Any accidentally committed credentials would be available to anyone with code access.

**Recommendation:**
Implement code scanning to detect potential hardcoded credentials.

## Conclusion

The application has several security concerns that should be addressed, primarily focused on:
1. Adding consistent authentication checks to all API endpoints
2. Implementing proper authorization controls
3. Improving input validation
4. Adding protection against common web security threats

Addressing these issues will significantly improve the security posture of the application and reduce the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.
